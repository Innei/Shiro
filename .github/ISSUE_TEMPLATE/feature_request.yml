        Thanks for your interest in the project and taking the time to fill out this feature report!

        However, due to personal experience, feature requests of any kind are not accepted at this time unless you are able to sponsor me a certain amount of money to support the time I spend developing needed features.

        Also, there will be no non-bug fixes or other routine maintenance updates in this open source project.

        If, however, you would like to receive newer iterations of features, please get [Shiroi](https://github.com/innei-dev/Shiroi) through sponsorship
